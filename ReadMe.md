## **Financial Calculator**


## Description
Creating a program that provides users with access to two different financial calculators an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator would offer a comprehensive tool for managing personal finances.

 - The investment calculator would enable users to analyze and project their investment returns, considering factors like initial investment, interest rates, and investment duration.
 - The home loan repayment calculator would help users determine their monthly mortgage payments, taking into account loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
 - This dual-function program would be invaluable for users looking to make informed financial decisions, whether planning for future investments or managing home loan repayments.
